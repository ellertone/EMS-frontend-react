# Event Management System - Admin Frontend

This project is the admin frontend for the Event Management System, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

The Event Management System admin frontend allows administrators to manage events, users, and other system settings. It provides an intuitive interface to create, edit, and delete events, as well as manage user roles and permissions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Refer to the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
